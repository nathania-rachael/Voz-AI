This project made for **AIQoD Hackathon 2025**, is an **AI-powered voice assistant** designed to help customers inquire about books, availability, pricing, stocks, and more at a bookstore. Customers can call the assistant, ask natural questions via voice, and receive **dynamic, AI-generated responses** based on real-time book inventory data powered by a RAG-based (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) system. The system leverages:

- **Twilio Programmable Voice (Speech-to-Text & Text-to-Speech)**
- **Ollama with LLaMA 3.1 8B** for natural language understanding and generation.
- **Contextual Memory and Friendly Learning** to improve user experience.
- **Flask Backend** is used to handle webhooks and inventory lookup.
- **Ngrok** Exposes the locally running Flask application to the public internet, allowing Twilio to access webhook endpoints.

### NOTE: This project currently uses a bookstore inventory (books.csv) as its knowledge base, but the system can be easily adapted to other domains like e-commerce, education, healthcare, or travel by replacing the dataset and fine-tuning the model for domain-specific queries and conversational responses.

## ✨ Key Features

### 🗣️ Voice Interface via Twilio
- Customers interact with the assistant entirely via voice.
- Twilio **Speech-to-Text (STT)** converts speech into text.
- Twilio **Text-to-Speech (TTS)** reads responses back to the caller.

### 📚 Real-Time Knowledge Retrieval
- Current book inventory is stored in `books.csv`.
- Questions about pricing, availability, reservation, and purchase are answered using this data.

### 🧠 Contextual Memory
- The assistant maintains **short-term memory** during a call session.
- If interrupted, it can recover gracefully and ask the user to repeat or clarify.
- It remembers the current topic within the session (e.g., book being discussed) to provide follow-up information smoothly.

### 🚪 Interruption Handling
- If the user interrupts the assistant while it's speaking, the assistant can pause and listen for the new input.
- This enhances the **natural flow** of conversation.

📂 project-root/
├── app.py                # Main Flask application
├── requirements.txt      # Python dependencies
├── books.csv              # Sample book inventory

## ⚙️ Setup Instructions

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/allen-reji/Voz-AI
cd project-root
```

### 2. Set up Virtual Environment (recommended)

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate   # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
```

### 3. Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 4. Prepare the Inventory Data (csv knowledge base of your choice, We have provided books.csv for bookstore inventory)

Create a `books.csv` file in the root folder with the following format:

```csv
book_name,author,genre,quantity_available,price,rating,format,language,pages,discount,bestseller
The Great Gatsby,F. Scott Fitzgerald,Classic,15,9.99,4.5,Paperback,English,180,10,Yes
1984,George Orwell,Dystopian,20,12.99,4.7,Hardcover,English,328,15,Yes
To Kill a Mockingbird,Harper Lee,Classic,18,14.99,4.8,Paperback,English,281,5,Yes
Pride and Prejudice,Jane Austen,Romance,12,11.99,4.6,Hardcover,English,432,10,Yes
```

This is the data the assistant will reference when answering user queries.

## 🏃 Running the Application

### Start Flask App
```bash
python app.py
```

The app will run on:
```
http://localhost:5000
```

### Start Ollama
Ensure **Ollama** is running with the required LLaMA model:
```bash
ollama serve
```
You may also need to pull the model if it's not available:
```bash
ollama pull llama3.1
```

---

## 📞 Twilio Integration

### Set Up a Programmable Voice Number
1. Get a free trial **Twilio phone number**.
2. Use **ngrok** to expose your local Flask server if running locally:
    ```bash
    ngrok http 5000
    ```
3. In Twilio Console, set the number’s **Voice Webhook URL** to:
    ```
    https://your-ngrok-url/voice
    ```

---

## 📊 System Flow

1. 📞 **User Calls Twilio Number**  
   The assistant greets the user and invites them to ask a question about books.

2. 🗣️ **User Asks a Question**  
   Twilio converts **speech to text** and sends the transcript to `/handle-input`.

3. 📚 **Knowledge Retrieval & AI Response**  
   - The assistant queries `books.csv` for inventory.
   - The query and data are passed to **LLaMA 3.1** via Ollama.
   - The AI generates a friendly, natural response.

4. 🔊 **AI Response Read Back**  
   Twilio’s **TTS** reads the AI-generated response to the caller.

5. 🔄 **Context Management & Follow-ups**  
   The assistant offers to answer follow-up questions and maintains short-term memory about the current topic.

6. 🚪 **Graceful Interruption Handling**  
   If the user interrupts while the assistant is speaking, the assistant will stop, listen, and respond to the new query.

## 🔧 Example Call Flow

```
👤 User: "Hi, do you have The Great Gatsby?"
🤖 Assistant: "Yes! The Great Gatsby is available for $10.99, and we have 5 copies in stock. Would you like me to check another book?"
👤 User: "Actually, do you have 1984?"
🤖 Assistant: "Sure! 1984 is available for $8.99, with 10 copies in stock."
👤 User: (interrupts) "What about Moby Dick?"
🤖 Assistant: "Moby Dick is available for $12.50, and we have 3 copies left. Anything else I can help with?"
